Cope
  About this time I grew annoyed of the floating letter parts I used to manually, painfully italicize the text the hard way.
  What am I, insane? Couldn't I have just made a single 15 degree reference line on the one workplane,
  and stretched the vertical construction lines parallel to it,
  instead of making a new part, workplane, and reference line for each letter?

  So I projected the italic letter parts as construction back onto the workplane from whence they were borne, and cleaned up the construction lines and geometry
